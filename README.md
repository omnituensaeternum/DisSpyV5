# DisSpyV5
Here we go again, Spyware for the masses thanks to shitcord, for all your ~~stalking~~ logging needs!
DisSpyV5 is a Python-based project designed for the tracking and logging of specific users of interest. 


## Features

- Tracks data in a personal discord server of your choosing and to a file
- Built in killswitch keyword that will wipe all discord side data if the program detects anyone saying the killswitch phrase.
- Logs user updates, messages, and attachments. (Future support for more events SoonTM)

## Requirements

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Pip (Python package manager)
- Run the setup script if you don't know what your doing skid.

## Setup

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/omnituensaeternum/DisSpyV5.git
cd DisSpyV5
```
Run the setup script or create a virtual python enviroment and install dependencies.

Ensure you populate cfg.py with the needed values or nothing will work, I recommend aged discord accounts for this program not new or easily lockable ones

Not responsible for what you do with this software, this is a self bot which is against discords TOS bla bla bla you know the drill.
